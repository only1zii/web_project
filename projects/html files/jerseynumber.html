        The Argentine sensation started his career at Camp Nou wearing the jersey number 30, and they were the initial
        seasons that Messi showed to the world his extra-terrestrial prowess on the ball.

        From dribbling two to three defenders at a time to taking those meaty thunderbolts that would go onto imbricate
        into the back of the net, Messi was just starting to warm up. In the seasons he donned the jersey number 30, he
        scored 9 goals from 34 matches.

        This was the Argentine magician plying his trade for the Catalan giants under the limelight of Ronaldinho and
        Samuel Eto. In the next two seasons, he chose the jersey number 19, already having established himself as a
        future star.

        In these two seasons, he started proliferating at his magnificent best, as he went on to score 33 goals from 76
        matches and exude an aura of irrepressible brilliance.

        This is when the little magician bloomed at his majestic best for the Catalans and came out of the shadow of
        Ronaldinho to take over the mantle of supremacy.

        In the next thirteen seasons, playing under the iconic number 10 jersey, Messi spawned a legacy so vivid that it
        would need God himself to come and break it. He played 668 matches and scored 639 goals, which were laced with
        innumerable assists. Keeping the glaring numbers aside, the gentry of football that was dished out by the
        diminutive magician was not just blazing, but simply unrivalled.

        Despite his supporters wanting him to take the jersey number 10 at PSG, he was not really interested in taking
        away Neymarâ€™s number.

        He chose to take the impressive number 30 with which he started his career at Camp Nou. I know people will be
        expecting this to be the onset of another iconic era but at the most Messi will most likely be playing 3 to 4
        more seasons which would hail the end of an era.
