        Back in 2013, it was reported that Messi bought all the rooms of his neighbor’s house so he could be alone. To
        elaborate, his neighbor was struggling with money, and thus, they rented out rooms.

        However, the new tenants couldn’t be any less noisy with their loud talks and music. Due to this apparent
        reason, Messi first tried to make a wall between them which the neighbor denied.

        Therewith, Messi bought all of his rooms so he could have peace. And that’s now what we call a luxurious
        solution to the problem, indeed.

        Similarly, back then, Messi was also a hit when Barcelona El Prat’s airport was in the talk for expansion. As we
        all know, Messi has made a rule that no airplanes can fly over his house.

        Also, the airport is just 10 km away from his house, and thus, the Vueling airline’s president Javier
        Sanchez-Prieto was in charge of it.

        During it, he had suggested expanding the airport through the suburbs of Gava and Castelldefels. But he couldn’t
        do so because of the rule Messi has set.

        Today, the area has been titled as an area of environmental restrictions. Also, he later stated it might have
        happened due to the influence of Messi.
