        Apart from his luxurious items, Messi has a powerful and stunning pet dog named Hulk or Senor Hulk.
        The dog is Dogue de Bordeaux, also known as a Bordeaux Mastiff or French Mastiff. Bordeaux Mastiff is the pet
        dog best known for its impeccable size and strength.

        Simply, they are mostly guarding dogs for protection, and often they have large heads. Likewise, Messiâ€™s dog has
        short hair of reddish-brown color.

        Of course, Messi never misses a chance ever to share pictures of Hulk on his social media platforms. Before
        Hulk, Messi had a pet named Tony.
