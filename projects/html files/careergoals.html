        Lionel Messi has bagged an enormous amount of goals for his club and country, but just how many times in total
        has he found the net?

        The current PSG star is not just one of the best players overall, but also one of the most lethal goal scorers.

        He is Barcelona's all-time top goal scorer for a reason.

        He is LaLiga's all-time top goalscorer for a reason.

        He is the record holder for goals scored in a single calendar year for a reason.

        But how many goals has Messi scored in total during his outrageous career at Barcelona, PSG, and Argentina?

        Let’s take a look!

        In the summer of 2021, Messi was forced to switch clubs owing to the Spanish outfit’s financial crisis.

        The Argentine’s first season with PSG was not quite up to his standards as he was unable to score as regularly
        as we had gotten used to.

        Come 2022, a more settled Messi looks in fine form once more.

        Under the new leadership of Christophe Galtier, Messi along with his partners in crime Neymar and Kylian Mbappe
        has formed a lethal trio and will look to bag all pieces of silverware available to them this season.
