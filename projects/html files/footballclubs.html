        Lionel Messi has played for four football clubs, including FC Barcelona and PSG, since he started playing. At
        the international level, he plays for Argentina.

        There’s not a single football team in the world which wouldn’t want to have Lionel Messi on its roster. After
        all, the Argentinian, a record seven-time Ballon d’Or winner, is one of the best players of all time.

        However, over the course of his 18-year-long professional career, Lionel Messi has only graced two clubs, FC
        Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).

        Taking into account the two Argentinian youth clubs he played, Lionel Messi has only played for four clubs in
        his career - a number quite low for modern-day footballers who end up playing for several clubs over the course
        of their career.
